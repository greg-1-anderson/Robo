# Getting Started

To begin you need to create a RoboFile. Just run `robo init` in empty dir:

```
robo init
```

This will create a new `RoboFile.php` for you. There will be RoboFile class which extends `\Robo\Tasks`, which includes all bundled tasks of Robo.

``` php
<?php
class RoboFile extends \Robo\Tasks
{
}
?>
```

## Commands

All public methods of the RoboFile class will be treated as **commands**. You can run them from the CLI and pass arguments.

``` php
<?php
class RoboFile extends \Robo\Tasks
{
    function hello($world)
    {
        $this->say("Hello, $world");
    }
}
?>
```

When we run:

```
robo hello davert
➜ Hello, davert
```

Method names should be camelCased. In CLI `camelCased` method will be available as `camel:cased` command.
`longCamelCased` method will be transformed to `long:camel-cased` command.

### Arguments

All method parameters without default values are treated as required arguments. In our example command `hello` requires one argument.
If you pass a default value to parameter the argument becomes optional:

``` php
<?php
    function hello($world = 'world')
    {
        $this->say("Hello, $world");
    }
?>
```

```
robo hello
➜ Hello, world
```

To accept multiple, variable arguments, define a parameter as an `array`; Robo will then pass all CLI arguments in this variable:

``` php
<?php
    function hello(array $world)
    {
        $this->say("Hello, " . implode(', ', $world));
    }
?>
```

```
robo hello davert jon bill bob
➜ Hello, davert, jon, bill, bob
```

### Options

To define command options you should define the last method parameter as an associative array where the keys define the option names and the values provide each option's default values:

``` php
<?php
    function hello($opts = ['silent' => false])
    {
        if (!$opts['silent']) $this->say("Hello, world");
    }
?>
```

```
robo hello
➜ Hello, world

robo hello --silent
```

A one-character shortcut can be specified for option:

``` php
<?php
    function hello($opts = ['silent|s' => false])
    {
        if (!$opts['silent']) $this->say("Hello, world");
    }
?>
```

Now command can be executed with '-s' to run in silent mode: 

```
robo hello -s
```

### Load From Other Directories

Robo can execute commands from a RoboFile located in different directory.
You can specify the path to another RoboFile by including the `--load-from` option:

```
robo run --load-from /path/to/my/other/project
```

### Pass-Through Arguments

Sometimes you need to pass arguments from your command into a task. A command line after the `--` characters is treated as one argument.
Any special character like `-` will be passed into without change.

``` php
<?php
    function ls($args)
    {
        $this->taskExec('ls')->args($args)->run();
    }
?>
```

```
robo ls -- Robo -c --all
 [Robo\Task\ExecTask] running ls Robo -c --all
 .  ..  CHANGELOG.md  codeception.yml  composer.json  composer.lock  docs  .git  .gitignore  .idea  LICENSE  README.md  robo  RoboFile.php  robo.phar  src  tests  .travis.yml  vendor
```

### Help

The help text for a command in a RoboFile may be provided in Doc-Block comments. An example help Doc-Block comment is shown below:

``` php
<?php
/**

```

Arguments and options are populated from annotations.

Initially added with [PR by @jonsa](https://github.com/consolidation-org/Robo/pull/71); now provided by the [consolidation/annotated-command](https://github.com/consolidation-org/annotated-command) project, which was factored out from Robo.

### Ignored methods

Robo ignores any method of your RoboFile that begins with `get` or `set`. These methods are presumed to be data accessors, not commands.  To implement a command whose name contains `get` or `set`, use the `@command` annotation.

``` php
<?php
    /**
     * @command set-alignment
     */
    function setAlignment($value)
    {
        ...
    }
?>
```

## Tasks

Robo commands typically divide the work they need to accomplish into **tasks**. The command first determines what needs to be done, inspecting current state if necessary, and then sets up and executes one or more tasks that make the actual changes needed by the command.  (See also the documentation on [Collections](collections.md), which allow you to combine groups of tasks which can provide rollback functions to recover from failure situations.)

The convention used to add new tasks for use in your RoboFiles is to create a wrapper trait that instantiates the implementation class for each task. Each task method in the trait should start with the prefix `task`, and should use **chained method calls** for configuration. Task execution should be triggered by the method `run`. 

*It is recommended to have store your trait loading task in a `loadTasks` file in the same namespace as the task implementation.*

A very basic task is shown below.  The namespace is `MyAssetTasks`, and the example task is `CompileAssets`. To customize to your purposes, choose an appropriate namespace, and then define as many tasks as you need.

``` php
<?php
namespace MyAssetTasks;

use Robo\Container\SimpleServiceProvider;

trait loadTasks
{
    /**
     * Return services.  Your tasks should always be
     * named 'taskCLASSNAME', where CLASSNAME is the
     * name of the implementing class.
     */
    public static function getMyAssetTasksServices()
    {
        return new SimpleServiceProvider(
            [
                'taskCompileAssets' => CompileAssets::class,
            ]
        );
    }

    /**
     * The task function must always be given the same name as the key
     * used with the SimpleServiceProvider (above)
     *
     * @param string $pathToCompileAssets
     * @return \MyAssetTasks\CompileAssets
     */
    protected function taskCompileAssets($path = null)
    {
        // Always construct your tasks with the `task()` task builder.
        return $this->task(__FUNCTION__, $path);
    }
}

class CompileAssets implements \Robo\Contract\TaskInterface
{
    // configuration params
    protected $path;
    protected $to;
    function __construct($path)
    {
        $this->path = $path;
    }

    function to($filename)
    {
        $this->to = $filename;
        // must return $this
        return $this;
    }

    // must implement Run
    function run()
    {
        //....
    }
}
?>
```
To use it in a RoboFile, you should register its service provider via the RoboFile's `getServiceProviders()` method, and also include the task via its trait:

``` php
<?php
class RoboFile extends \Robo\Tasks
{
    use \MyAssetTasks\loadTasks;

    public function getServiceProviders()
    {
        $serviceProviders = parent::getServiceProviders();
        $serviceProviders[] = \MyAssetTasks\loadTasks::getMyAssetTasksServices();

        return $serviceProviders;
    }

    public function build()
    {
        $this->taskCompileAssets('web/css-src')
            ->to('web/assets.min.css')
            ->run();
    }
}
?>
```

Robo\Tasks includes all of the standard task traits by default, so a RoboFile may call the `$this->taskXXX` method for any of these tasks. To use an external task, ensure that its class files are available (e.g. `require` its project in your composer.json file), register the services defined in the project's loadTraits, and include corresponding trait or traits in your Robofile.

### Shortcuts

Some tasks may have shortcuts. If a task does not require multi-step configuration, it can be executed with a single line:
 
```php
<?php
$this->_exec('ps aux');
$this->_copy('config/env.example.yml','config/env.yml');
?>
```

### Result

Each task must return an instance of `Robo\Result`. A Robo Result contains the task instance, exit code, message, and any variable data that the task may wish to return.

The `run` method of `CompileAssets` class may look like this:

```
return new Robo\Result($this, $exitCode, "Assets compiled");
```

or

```
return Robo\Result::success($this, "Assets compiled");
return Robo\Result::error($this, "Failed to compile assets");
```

You can use this results to check if execution was successful, either using the `wasSuccessful()` method, or via the `invoke` shortcut. We will use the `Exec` task in next example to illustrate this:

``` php
<?php
class RoboFile
{
    use Robo\Task\Base\loadShortcuts;

    function test()
    {
        $res1 = $this->_exec('phpunit tests/integration');
        $res2 = $this->_exec('phpunit tests/unit');

        // print message when tests passed
        if ($res1->wasSuccessful() and $res2->wasSuccessful()) $this->say("All tests passed");
    }
}
?>
```

Some tasks may also attach data to the Result object.  If this is done, the data may be accessed as an array; for example, `$result['path'];`. This is not common.

Commands should return a Result object obtained from a task; this will ensure that the command exit code is set correctly.  If a command does not have a Result object available, then it may use a ResultData object.  ResultData objects are just like Result objects, except the do not contain a reference to a task.

return new Robo\ResultData($exitcode, 'Error message.');

If the command returns a TaskInterface instead of a result, then the task will be executed, and the result from that task will be used as the final result of the command. See also `Formatters`, below.

### Stack

Some tasks contain `Stack` in their name. These are called "stack" tasks, and they execute similar tasks one after the other.  Each of the primary methods in a stack class executes an operation.

Stack tasks also contain a `stopOnFail` method which can be used to stop task execution if one of its commands was unsuccessful.

### Global StopOnFail

There is a global `stopOnFail` method as well, that can be used to stop a command on first failure of a task.

```
$this->stopOnFail(true);
```

### IO

As you noticed, you can print text via the `say` method, which is taken from the `Robo\Output` trait.

```
$this->say("Hello");
```

Also, you can ask for input from console:

```
$name = $this->ask("What is your name?");
```

There are also `askDefault`, `askHidden`, and `confirm` methods.

Inside tasks you should print process details with `printTaskInfo`, ``printTaskSuccess`, and `printTaskError`.

To allow tasks access IO, use the `Robo\Common\TaskIO` trait, or inherit your task class from `Robo\Task\BaseTask` (recommended).
```
$this->printTaskInfo('Processing...');
```
The Task IO methods send all output through a PSR-3 logger. Tasks should use task IO exclusively; methods such as 'say' and 'ask' should reside in the command method. This allows tasks to be usable in any context that has a PSR-3 logger, including background or server processes where it is not possible to directly query the user.

### Formatters

It is preferable for commands that look up and display information should avoid doing IO directly, and should instead return the data they wish to display as an array. This data can then be converted into different data formats, such as "table" and "json". The user may select which formatter to use via the --format option.

### Progress

Robo supports progress indicators via the Symfony ProgressBar class.  Long-running tasks that wish to display the progress indicator may do so via four simple steps:

- Override the `progressIndicatorSteps()` method and return the number of "steps" in the operation.
- Call `$this->startProgressIndicator()` to begin the progress indicator running.
- Call `$this->advanceProgressIndicator()` a number of times equal to the result returned by `progressIndicatorSteps()`
- Call `$this->stopProgressIndicator()` when the operation is completed.

An example of this is shown below:

``` php
<?php
class MyTask extends BaseTask
{
    protected $steps = 10;
    
    public function progressIndicatorSteps()
    {
        return $this->steps;
    }
    
    public function run()
    {
        $exitCode = 0;
        $errorMessage = "";
    
        $this->startProgressIndicator();
        for ($i = 0; $i < $this->steps; ++$i) {
            $this->advanceProgressIndicator();
        }
        $this->stopProgressIndicator();

        return new Result($this, $exitCode, $errorMessage, ['time' => $this->getExecutionTime()]);
    }
}
?>
```
Tasks should not attempt to use a specific progress indicator (e.g. the Symfony ProgressBar class) directly, as the ProgressIndicatorAwareTrait allows for an appropriate progress indicator to be used (or omitted) as best suits the application.

Note that when using [Collections](collections.md), the progress bar will automatically be shown if the collection takes longer than two seconds to run.  Each task in the collection will count for one "step"; if the task supports progress indicators as shown above, then it will add an additional number of steps as indicated by its `progressIndicatorSteps()` method.
